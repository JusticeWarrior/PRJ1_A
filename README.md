Processor Simulation
==========

Simulates the usage of a processor as processes enter and complete. Arrival and comletion times are estimated with a poisson random variable in which the processor handles them on a first come first serve basis. Processes can by-pass the queue with a priority setting and the simulation can handle variable quantities of high and low priority processes.
